# Product Scraping Bot

In this project I aimed to scrap gather data which are mentioned by my customer. This bot can take the data of a product which its link is taken by text area on the UI of this program. This bot only works on the website that is mentioned by my client. Bot will gather the data about a product and write it on a .xlsx file which is named as current date. This program will be work with multithreading to make get requests and html parsing quicker. Code includes so many try-except blocks to minimize the data loss caused by internet connection and computer.

## Libraries Those are Used In This Project:

- Requests(for scraping data)
- BeautifulSoup4(for parsing html)
- tkinter(for UI)
- datetime(for naming the csv file)
- openpyxl(excel file operations)
- concurrent.futures(to generate a multithreading pool)
