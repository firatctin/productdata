# Product Scraping Bot

In this project I aimed to scrap product data which are mentioned by my customer on freelancer website bionluk. This bot can take the data of a product which its link is taken by text area on the UI of this program. This bot only works on the website that is mentioned by my client. Bot will gather the data about a product and write it on a csv file which is named as current date.

## Libraries Those are Used In This Project:

- Requests(for scraping data)
- BeautifulSoup4(for scraping data)
- tkinter(for UI)
- datetime(for naming the csv file)
- csv(for csv operations)
